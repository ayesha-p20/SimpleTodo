## Notes

Creating this app was one of the most enjoyable coding projects that I have worked on. However, since I have no prior experience of creating an android app, I did run into a few obstacles while working on this project.
It took me a while to get used to the environment and understand what the code means. In fact, I had to rewatch certain sections of the videos to comprehend why the code has been written in a specific way. I also ran into multiple errors, because of which I had to spend a good amount of time debugging my code. 
On the whole though, creating the Simple Todo App was a good learning experience and a fun introduction to Android Studio
